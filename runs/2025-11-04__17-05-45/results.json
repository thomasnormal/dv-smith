Examine the test code, understand what's missing, and implement whatever is needed.\n\nYour implementation will be validated by:\n- Successful compilation with Xcelium\n- Simulation completes without UVM errors\n- Coverage shows BIT_8 and WRITE transactions were exercised\n\nSee `prompt.md` for the task description and `TESTBENCH_GUIDE.md` for testbench documentation.",
