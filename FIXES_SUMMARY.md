# Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: Python Version Mismatch ✅

**Problem:** README.md claimed Python 3.8+ but pyproject.toml required Python 3.10+

**Fixed:**
- Updated README.md badge: `Python 3.10+`
- Updated README.md prerequisites: `Python 3.10+`
- Updated pyproject.toml mypy config: `python_version = "3.10"`

**Files changed:**
- README.md (lines 4, 32)
- pyproject.toml (line 55)

## Issue 2: Pydantic Validation Error in Ingest Command ✅

**Problem:** AI-powered ingest command failed with validation errors because the tool schema and response handling didn't have a clear contract.

**Root cause:** 
- The FinalAnswer tool schema included metadata fields (title, description, etc.)
- Response validation tried to handle various wrapper formats instead of enforcing a contract

**Fixed:**
- Simplified tool schema to only include `properties` and `required` fields
- Removed hacky parsing logic that tried to unwrap various response formats
- Made the tool description explicit: "Pass the fields directly as tool parameters"
- Removed `additionalProperties: False` which was causing schema conflicts

**Files changed:**
- dvsmith/core/ai_structured.py (lines 39-68)

**Design principle:** Define clear contracts and enforce them, rather than trying to handle every possible variation.

## Testing

Both fixes verified:
1. ✅ `dvsmith ingest test_repos/test_uvm_bench --name clean_test` completes successfully
2. ✅ Profile generated correctly with all test metadata
3. ✅ No Pydantic validation errors
