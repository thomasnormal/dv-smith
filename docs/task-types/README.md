# Task-Type Guidelines

This directory contains reference guides for the primary Terminal-Bench task categories used in DV Smith:

- [Assertion](assertion.md) – SystemVerilog protocol assertions.
- [Coverage](coverage.md) – Closing functional/code coverage bins using Xcelium.
- [Sequence / Stimulus](sequence.md) – UVM sequences and tests that drive stimulus.

Each document describes the expected task structure, instruction content, testing approach, simulator integration, and reference solution requirements. Use these guides when authoring new tasks or extending the scaffolding/validator so behavior stays consistent across the benchmark.
