instruction: |-
  You are given access to a UVM-based AXI4 testbench environment.
  Read AGENTS.md for details on how to work the testbench.

  Task: Write a UVM test called axi4_blocking_incr_burst_read_test
  that performs AXI4 read transactions with INCR burst type.

  ### Read Transactions (3 transactions):
  - Transfer size: 4 bytes (ARSIZE=2 for 32-bit transfers)
  - Burst type: INCR (ARBURST=1)
  - Burst length: Can be random (not constrained)

  ### General Requirements:
  - The test should perform BLOCKING read transfers (not non-blocking)
  - This is a READ-ONLY test (no write transactions)
  - Use INCR burst type for all transactions
  - Ensure proper handshaking on all AXI4 channels

  ## Grading

  Your test will be graded based on three criteria:

  ### Scoreboard Validation (40%)
  - No UVM_ERROR or UVM_FATAL messages in simulation
  - All transactions complete successfully

  ### Functional Coverage (50%)
  - Read channel coverage bins:
    - ARSIZE_4BYTES (4-byte transfer size)
    - ARBURST_CP -> WRITE_INCR (INCR burst type)

  ### Performance (10%)
  - Simulation efficiency (coverage achieved per microsecond of sim time)

  ## Hints
  1. Extend from `axi4_base_test`
  2. Set the environment mode to `ONLY_READ_DATA` in setup_axi4_env_cfg()
  3. Create a virtual sequence that starts master and slave read sequences
  4. Use blocking read sequences for both master and slave
  5. The master sequence should constrain transactions to use INCR burst type
  6. Run the master sequence 3 times (using `repeat(3)`) to generate multiple transactions
  7. Start the slave sequence in a `fork/join_none` to handle responses
  8. Make sure to raise and drop objections appropriately
