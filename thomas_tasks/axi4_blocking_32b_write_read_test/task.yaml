instruction: |-
  You are given access to a UVM-based AXI4 testbench environment.
  Read AGENTS.md for details on how to work the testbench.

  Task: Write a UVM test called student_example_32b_write_read_test
  that performs the following AXI4 transactions:

  ### Write Transactions (2 transactions):
  - Burst length: Mix of 1 beat (AWLEN=0) and 4 beats (AWLEN=3)
  - Transfer size: Mix of 1 byte (AWSIZE=0) and 4 bytes (AWSIZE=2)
  - Burst type: FIXED (AWBURST=0)
  - At least one transaction should use each burst length

  ### Read Transactions (3 transactions):
  - Burst length: Mix of 1 beat (ARLEN=0) and 2 beats (ARLEN=1)
  - Transfer size: Mix of 1 byte (ARSIZE=0) and 4 bytes (ARSIZE=2)
  - Burst type: Mix of FIXED (ARBURST=0) and INCR (ARBURST=1)
  - At least one transaction should use each burst length

  ### General Requirements:
  - The test should perform BLOCKING transfers (not non-blocking)
  - Use different transaction IDs to test ID handling
  - Ensure proper handshaking on all AXI4 channels

  ## Grading

  Your test will be graded based on three criteria:

  ### Scoreboard Validation (40%)
  - No UVM_ERROR or UVM_FATAL messages in simulation
  - All transactions complete successfully

  ### Functional Coverage (50%)
  - Write channel coverage bins:
    - AWLEN_1, AWLEN_4 (burst lengths)
    - AWSIZE_1BYTE, AWSIZE_4BYTES (transfer sizes)
    - AWBURST_FIXED (burst type)
  - Read channel coverage bins:
    - ARLEN_1, ARLEN_2 (burst lengths)
    - ARSIZE_1BYTE, ARSIZE_4BYTES (transfer sizes)
    - ARBURST_FIXED, ARBURST_INCR (burst types)

  ### Performance (10%)
  - Simulation efficiency (coverage achieved per microsecond of sim time)

  ## Hints
  1. Extend from `axi4_base_test`
  2. Create a virtual sequence that starts both write and read sequences
  3. Use the appropriate master sequences for 32-bit transfers
  4. The slave should be configured to respond to write and read requests
  5. Make sure to raise and drop objections appropriately
