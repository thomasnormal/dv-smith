instruction: |-
  You are given access to a UVM-based AXI4 testbench environment.
  Read AGENTS.md for details on how to work with the testbench.

  Task: Write a UVM test called student_example_wrap_burst_write_read_test
  that performs AXI4 transactions with wrapping burst type.

  ### Write Transactions (2 transactions):
  - Transfer size: 2 bytes (AWSIZE=1, corresponding to WRITE_2_BYTES)
  - Burst type: WRAP (AWBURST=2, corresponding to WRITE_WRAP)
  - The test should perform BLOCKING transfers (not non-blocking)

  ### Read Transactions (3 transactions):
  - Transfer size: 4 bytes (ARSIZE=2, corresponding to READ_4_BYTES)
  - Burst type: WRAP (ARBURST=2, corresponding to READ_WRAP)
  - The test should perform BLOCKING transfers (not non-blocking)

  ### General Requirements:
  - The test should perform BLOCKING transfers (not non-blocking)
  - Use appropriate transaction IDs for proper ID handling
  - Ensure proper handshaking on all AXI4 channels
  - The slave sequences must be started on the slave sequencers to handle incoming transactions

  ## CRITICAL: File Locations and Registration

  **Where to create files:**
  - Test file: `~/axi4_avip/src/hvl_top/test/student_example_wrap_burst_write_read_test.sv`
  - Virtual sequence: `~/axi4_avip/src/hvl_top/test/virtual_sequences/<your_vseq>.sv`
  - Master sequences: `~/axi4_avip/src/hvl_top/test/sequences/master_sequences/<your_seq>.sv`

  **DO NOT** create test files in `/tests/` - that directory is for pytest files only!

  **Package Registration (REQUIRED):**
  After creating each file, you MUST add an include directive to the appropriate package file:
  - Test: Add `\`include "student_example_wrap_burst_write_read_test.sv"` to `~/axi4_avip/src/hvl_top/test/axi4_test_pkg.sv`
  - Virtual sequence: Add `\`include "<your_vseq>.sv"` to `~/axi4_avip/src/hvl_top/test/virtual_sequences/axi4_virtual_seq_pkg.sv`
  - Master sequences: Add `\`include "<your_seq>.sv"` to `~/axi4_avip/src/hvl_top/test/sequences/master_sequences/axi4_master_seq_pkg.sv`

  The include directives should be added before the `endpackage` statement (or after the last similar include).

  ## CRITICAL: Test Your Code!

  **You MUST compile and simulate your test to verify it works:**
  ```bash
  cd ~/axi4_avip/sim/cadence_sim
  make compile
  make simulate test=student_example_wrap_burst_write_read_test
  ```

  If compilation fails, check:
  - Did you add all necessary `\`include` directives to package files?
  - Are your files in the correct directories?
  - Do your class names match the file names?

  If simulation fails, check the log file:
  ```bash
  grep -E "UVM_ERROR|UVM_FATAL|UVM_WARNING" student_example_wrap_burst_write_read_test/student_example_wrap_burst_write_read_test.log
  ```

  **Do not submit without testing!** The grading system will fail immediately if your code doesn't compile or has UVM errors.

  ## Grading

  Your test will be graded based on three criteria:

  ### Scoreboard Validation (40%)
  - No UVM_ERROR or UVM_FATAL messages in simulation
  - All transactions complete successfully

  ### Functional Coverage (50%)
  - Write channel coverage bins:
    - AWSIZE_2BYTES (transfer size)
    - AWBURST_WRAP (burst type)
  - Read channel coverage bins:
    - ARSIZE_4BYTES (transfer size)
    - ARBURST_WRAP (burst type)

  ### Performance (10%)
  - Simulation efficiency (coverage achieved per microsecond of sim time)

  ## Hints
  1. Extend from `axi4_base_test`
  2. Create master sequences that constrain the transaction parameters:
     - For writes: `awsize == WRITE_2_BYTES` and `awburst == WRITE_WRAP`
     - For reads: `arsize == READ_4_BYTES` and `arburst == READ_WRAP`
  3. Create a virtual sequence that starts both master and slave sequences
  4. The slave should use existing slave wrap burst sequences (axi4_slave_bk_write_wrap_burst_seq and axi4_slave_bk_read_wrap_burst_seq)
  5. Make sure to raise and drop objections appropriately
  6. Remember to start slave sequences in forever loops using fork/join_none
