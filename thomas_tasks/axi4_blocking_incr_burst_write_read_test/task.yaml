  You are given access to a UVM-based AXI4 testbench environment.
  Read AGENTS.md for details on how to work with the testbench.

  Task: Write a UVM test called student_example_incr_burst_write_read_test
  that performs AXI4 transactions with incrementing burst type.

  ### Write Transactions (2 transactions):
  - Transfer size: 2 bytes (AWSIZE=1, corresponding to WRITE_2_BYTES)
  - Burst type: INCR (AWBURST=1, corresponding to WRITE_INCR)
  - The test should perform BLOCKING transfers (not non-blocking)

  ### Read Transactions (3 transactions):
  - Transfer size: 4 bytes (ARSIZE=2, corresponding to READ_4_BYTES)
  - Burst type: INCR (ARBURST=1, corresponding to READ_INCR)
  - The test should perform BLOCKING transfers (not non-blocking)

  ### General Requirements:
  - The test should perform BLOCKING transfers (not non-blocking)
  - Use appropriate transaction IDs for proper ID handling
  - Ensure proper handshaking on all AXI4 channels
  - The slave sequences must be started on the slave sequencers to handle incoming transactions

  ## Grading

  Your test will be graded based on three criteria:

  ### Scoreboard Validation (40%)
  - No UVM_ERROR or UVM_FATAL messages in simulation
  - All transactions complete successfully

  ### Functional Coverage (50%)
  - Write channel coverage bins:
    - AWSIZE_2BYTES (transfer size)
    - WRITE_INCR (burst type)
  - Read channel coverage bins:
    - ARSIZE_4BYTES (transfer size)
    - WRITE_INCR (burst type)

  ### Performance (10%)
  - Simulation efficiency (coverage achieved per microsecond of sim time)

  ## Hints
  1. Extend from `axi4_base_test`
  2. Create master sequences that constrain the transaction parameters:
     - For writes: `awsize == WRITE_2_BYTES` and `awburst == WRITE_INCR`
     - For reads: `arsize == READ_4_BYTES` and `arburst == READ_INCR`
  3. Create a virtual sequence that starts both master and slave sequences
  4. The slave should use existing slave incr burst sequences (axi4_slave_bk_write_incr_burst_seq and axi4_slave_bk_read_incr_burst_seq)
  5. Make sure to raise and drop objections appropriately
  6. Remember to start slave sequences in forever loops using fork/join_none
